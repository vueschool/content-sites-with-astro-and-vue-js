# Content Sites with Astro and Vue.js

This repository contains the example code for the [Content Sites with Astro and Vue.js](https://vueschool.io/courses/content-sites-with-astro-and-vue-js) course.

Combining Vue.js with Astro for building content sites, like blogs or docs, makes for a blazing-fast site and an A+ developer experience. Why? Astro is a modern front-end framework that allows you to build with the JavaScript technology of your choice (think React, Vue, Svelte, and more) but doesnâ€™t ship any JavaScript by default. This is known as an islands architecture, where we opt-in to JavaScript instead of vice-versa.

In this course, learn the basics of getting started with Astro by building a simple blog. Also, learn to integrate it with your favorite JavaScript framework Vue.js for templating thatâ€™s familiar and for sprinkling in interactivity only where required.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
